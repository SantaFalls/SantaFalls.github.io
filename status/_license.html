LICENSE FOR HALFLINGS IN BOOTSTRAP<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
GLYPHICONS Halflings font is also released as an extension of a Bootstrap (www.getbootstrap.com) for free and it is released under the same license as Bootstrap. While you are not required to include attribution on your Bootstrap-based projects, I would certainly appreciate any form of support, even a nice Tweet is enough. Of course if you want, you can say thank you and support me by buying more icons on www.glyphicons.com.<br />
